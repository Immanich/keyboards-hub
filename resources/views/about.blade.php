                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm Lord Immanuel Juanich, a third-year 
                Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) 
                student. I am passionate about technology and constantly 
                eager to learn new skills and concepts in the field of IT. 
                My interests include software development, web design, and 
                exploring the latest trends in technology. In my spare time, 
                I enjoy coding, gaming, or
